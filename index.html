            <h2>Why Pest Control Is Vital for Your Home and Business</h2>
            <p>
                Pests are more than just an inconvenience—they can pose serious health risks and cause significant property damage. Rodents can chew through wires, increasing the risk of electrical fires, while termites silently weaken the structural integrity of your property. Additionally, pests like cockroaches and bed bugs can carry allergens and diseases, impacting the well-being of your family or employees. Regular pest control not only eliminates these threats but also prevents future infestations, ensuring long-term peace of mind.
